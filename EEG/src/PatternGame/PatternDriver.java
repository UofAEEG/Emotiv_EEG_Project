/*
 * BUGS:
 *  This program does not record randomly selected 1 second long intervals of the break
 */

/*  NOTES:
 *  This program does not do the "check quality or exit" feature, as I think this is unnecessary since we visually
 *  confirm connection quality before running the program
 */

/*
 * The pattern game
 * 
 * 
 * Turn on the helmet, start the program.
 * Wait 10 sec for patterns to settle down.
 * Check the Connection Quality (abort the program if not all connections are perfect with an error message, don't waste time on any UI here)
 *
 * Repeat for <p> = {A, B, C}
 *   ask user to think pattern <p>, record the data into a Matrix object for 10s. Name it file_<p>.txt
 *
 * #train SVM
 *
 * Repeat for <i> = 1...N  (N = 10)
 *   repeat pattern <p> = {A, R1, B, R2, C, R3}
 *       if <p> == R1 or R2 or R3
 *           ask the user to take a break for a couple seconds, record a randomly selected 1 seconds long interval of the break into file_<i>_<R?>.txt
 *       else
 *           ask user to think <p> for 1 sec. record data into file_<i>_<p>.txt
